# Delivery-Logistics-Analysis
End-to-end data analysis project on delivery logistics using Python, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature analysis, and insights to improve logistics and supply chain performance.

# Delivery Logistics Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing delivery logistics data to identify key factors affecting delivery performance.
The goal is to extract actionable insights using data analysis and machine learning techniques to support
data-driven decision-making in logistics and supply chain operations.

## Problem Statement
Delivery efficiency is influenced by multiple factors such as distance, delivery time, traffic conditions,
and operational delays. Understanding these factors helps businesses optimize logistics, reduce costs,
and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle / Provided Dataset
- File Name: `dataset.csv`
- Description: Contains delivery-related attributes such as distance, delivery time, delays,
  and operational features used for analysis and modeling.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building (if applicable)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Insights and Conclusions

## Key Insights
- Identified major factors impacting delivery performance.
- Analyzed trends and patterns affecting delivery delays.
- Built a structured analytical workflow suitable for real-world logistics problems.

## Results
The analysis provides clear insights into delivery efficiency drivers and demonstrates how data science
can be applied to logistics and supply chain optimization.
